# MythTV PVR
MythTV PVR client addon for [Kodi](http://kodi.tv)

## Build instructions
When building the addon you have to use the correct branch depending on which version of Kodi you're building against.
For example, if you're building the `master` branch of Kodi you should checkout the `master` branch of this repository. Also make sure you follow this README from the branch in question.

### Linux

    git clone --branch=master --depth=1 https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc.git
    git clone --branch=master https://github.com/janbar/pvr.mythtv.git
    cd pvr.mythtv && mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DADDONS_TO_BUILD=pvr.mythtv -DADDON_SRC_PREFIX=../.. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../xbmc/addons -DPACKAGE_ZIP=ON ../../xbmc/cmake/addons
    make

The addon files will be placed in `../../xbmc/kodi-build/addons` so if you build Kodi from source and run it directly
the addon will be available as a system addon.
